# HectorCastelli Packs

This is a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) with multiple DataPacks and ResourcePacks developed by me.

## Structure

All of the packs (DataPacks and ResourcePacks) are located in the [`packs/`](./packs/) directory.

Each directory relates to one pack, which may require both a DataPack and a ResourcePack to function.

## Versioning

This repository officially supports the latest release version of when the packs are built.

Any changes or updates to the packs will not be applied retroactively. This means that updates are only available if you keep updating your game version to match the repository.

When a new release of Minecraft ships, the packs will be updated and new versions will be published eventually.

Always check the latest release to see which minecraft versions are supported.
